# 22. Tries
## Overview
### Sorting Summary
- sort problem: take sequence of objects + put in order
- search problem: store collection with rapid retrieval
- BSTmap ~ comparison-based sorting
- hashmaps ~ counting-based sorting
- digit-by-digit: tries ~ LSd/MSD sort
### Terminology
- L: length of string key
- R: alphabet size
### Tries
- store letters implicitly in edge links
- fastest (but most memory-wasteful): store array of size R (R-way tries)
### Trie Advantages
- fast lookup: never more than number of characters in query
- supports efficient operations:
	- longestPrefixOf, prefix-matching

### Problem 3    
Problem 8 from  [Princeton’s Spring 2012 final](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring15/cos226/exams/fin-f12.pdf).
[solution](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-s12-sol.pdf)
### Problem 4
Draw the R-way trie that result after inserting the strings: sam, sad, sap, same, a, awls.
*Note: to avoid drawing giant arrays, our alphabet is assumed to only have 8 letters: a, d, e, l, m, p, s, w.*

Remember that in a R-way trie, links are implicit (based on array indices)--the nodes don't actually store their letter values. The letter values in the figure are labeled for convenience.

## B Level
### Problem 1
When looking for a single character string in a Trie, what is the worst case time to find that string in terms of R and N?
**Ans**: Θ(L), where L is the length of the string--it doesn't depend on R or N.

## A Level
### Problem 1
There are many different data structures that we can use to store the children of an R-way trie node. The simplest but most memory hungry choice is to create an array of length R, with one link per character in the trie. A second choice is to have each node contain a TreeMap that maps a given character to the appropriate node. A third choice is to use HashMaps instead of TreeMaps. For the “average” node, which of these three choices is likely to use the most memory? Why does this mean that this type of node takes longer to construct?

**Ans**: The R-way trie uses the most memory: an "average" node is sparse (not utilizing the full alphabet), so a lot of memory is wasted on mostly null links. For each node you construct, you also have to create a length-R array, which can slow down the initialization time. 

### Problem 2
Suppose we use an R-way trie to implement a set. For each of the three implementations of an R-way trie node described in problem 1, what are the best and worst case key lookup times in terms of R and N?

**Ans**: 
*Assuming L is the length of the string*
R-way trie: Θ(1), Θ(L) - array access is constant time
Treemap: Θ(1), Θ(L log R) - L characters, and each one takes log R time to find in BST
HashMap: Θ(1), Θ(LR) - assuming all keys hash to the same bucket
