# 6. ALists, Resizing, vs. SLists
## Overview
### Lists vs. Arrays
- `get` in a linked list is slow (linear scan)
- arrays can access in constant time
### AList
- API: `addLast`, `getLast`, `removeLast`, `get`, `size`
- invariants:
	- `addLast` puts in position `size`, `getLast` returns pos `size - 1`
	- number of items: `size`
### ALit Implementation
- AList has underlying array `items`
- `addLast`: put in `items[size]`
- `getLast`: return `items[size - 1]`
- `removeLast`: decrement `size`
	- nulling out removed objects is unnecessary, but saves memory
### Abstraction
- hide implementation details
### Array Resizing
- resize by creating new larger array + copying values
- arithmetic resizing slow, geometric is fast (`size * FACTOR`)
- downsize when mostly empty to save memory
### Helper Methods
- break large methods into smaller ones -> unit testing
### Generic AList
- arrays cannot be generic, use casting: `items = (Item[]) new Object[100];`
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
Complete the exercises from the online textbook  [here](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/chap25.html).

**Optional Exercise 2.5.1:**  Try to build an AList class that supports  `addLast`,  `getLast`,  `get`, and  `size`  operations. Your AList should work for any size array up to 100. For starter code, see  [https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/lectureCode/tree/master/lists4/DIY](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/lectureCode/tree/master/lists4/DIY).
```java]
/** Integer array-based List without resizing */
public class AList {
    /** Creates an empty list. */
    int[] items;
    int size;

    public AList() {
	    items = new int[100];
	    size = 0;
    }

    /** Inserts X into the back of the list. */
    public void addLast(int x) {
	    items[size] = x;
	    size += 1;
    }

    /** Returns the item from the back of the list. */
    public int getLast() {
        return items[size - 1];      
    }
    /** Gets the ith item in the list (0 is the front). */
    public int get(int i) {
        return items[i];       
    }

    /** Returns the number of items in the list. */
    public int size() {
        return size;     
    }

    /** Deletes item from back of the list and
      * returns deleted item. */
    public int removeLast() {
        size -= 1;
        return items[size];
    }
} 
```
**Optional Exercise 2.5.3:**  Suppose we have an AList in the state shown in the figure below. What will happen if we call  `addLast(11)`? What should we do about this problem?
![dllist_circular_sentinel_size_2.png](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/fig25/full_naive_alist.png)

**Ans**: You can't add--you'll get an IndexOutOfBounds error if you try to access items[100]. To circumvent this issue, you need to resize (by copying over the items to a new, larger array).

**Exercise 2.5.4:**  Try to implement the  `addLast(int i)`  method to work with resizing arrays.
```java
/** Inserts X into the back of the list. */
public void addLast(int x) {
	if (size == items.length) {
		resize(capacity * 2);
	}
	items[size] = x;
	size += 1;
}

private void resize(int capacity) {
	int[] newItems = new int[capacity];
	System.arraycopy(items, 0, newItems, 0, size);
	items = newItems;
}
```
**Exercise 2.5.5:**  Suppose we have an array of size 100. If we call insertBack two times, how many total boxes will we need to create and fill throughout this entire process? How many total boxes will we have at any one time, assuming that garbage collection happens as soon as the last reference to an array is lost?

**Ans**: Calling insertBack twice causes 101 + 102 = 203 new memory boxes to be created. At any one time, there will be max 203 active memory boxes.

**Exercise 2.5.6:**  Starting from an array of size 100, approximately how many memory boxes get created and filled if we call  `addLast`  1,000 times?

**Ans**: 101 + 102 + ... 1001 ~ 500,000

## B Level
### Problem 1
Think of some of the problems you would experience in writing an  `addFirst`  method, and think of some potential solutions. If you think youâ€™ve got a good one, write it out.

**Ans**: The potential issue is a lack space at the front of the array (the 0th index is filled). Solutions: (1) Create a circular array (similar to ArrayDeque in Proj1). (2) Have empty space on both sides of the array (for example, start the array at index 10), and resize when the 0th index is filled. This is bad because it consumes excess memory. (3) Resize every time you addFirst. This is even worse because it will be super slow (linear time per add), but suprisingly this is Java's actual implementation ([source](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/java/util/ArrayList.java)).
### Problem 2
Do the bonus question from this [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LGQeMHb8-HFKdvJi5nGKRIPZt4on18fZe-cIyTJv8_4/edit#slide=id.g1c42a46f23_4_396).

**Ans**: When resizing from 999 -> 1000, you will have an array of size 999 and another of size 1000 at the same time = 1999 memory boxes total.
