# 38. Compression
## Overview
### Compression Models
- bits B -> compression alg C -> C(B) -> decompression alg -> B
- goal: C(B) < B
### Variable-Length Codewords
- use variable-length codewords to represent symbols
	- shorter = more common
- ex: Morse code
### Prefix-Free Codes
- codes where no codeword is prefix of another
- unique decoding possible
### Shannon-Fano Coding
1) count occurences
2) recursively split into halves based on freq, assign each half 0/1 at end
### Huffman Coding
- provably optimal
1) count occurences, create node for each symbol
2) merge lowerst occurence nodes into tree with supernode as root
3) append 0 or 1 to each half at beginning
4) repeat until all symbols in tree
### Huffman Implementation
- encoding:
	- count freq, build encoding array/decoding trie
	- write trie to output
	- look up symbols in encoding array + write bitsequence
- decompression:
	- read trie
	- use longest prefix matching to recover
### General Encoding Principles
- common symbols -> few bits
- other ideas: RLE (char + numOccurences), LZW (search for patterns)
- exploit existing order, redundancy
### Universal Compression
- impossible!
- argument 1: just keep compressing until everything is 1 bit
- argument 2: for 1000-bit stream, only 1/2^499^ are compressible by 50%, due to pigeonhole
### Self-Extracting Bits
- include the alg itself in the compressed bits when considering compressed size
- when fed to interpreter, alg + bitsequence product output

## C Level
### Problem 1
Problem  [4 from the Princeton 2008 Spring Final](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall12/cos226/exams/fin-s08.pdf#page=5).

## B Level
### Problem 1
Give an example of a 4 symbol code that is not prefix free or suffix free, but which is still “uniquely decodable”. By uniquely decodable, we mean that any sequence of bits can be unambiguously converted back into the correct sequence of bits.

**Ans**: There are probably many correct answers, but one example would be {0011 -> A, 00 -> B, 01 -> C, 10 -> D}. Note that whle 00 is a prefix of 0011, the sequence 0011 is still uniquely decodeable to A. 
For example, consider the following sequence 01**0011**1000. We can either decode this as 0011, or 00 and then 11. However note that 11 is not present in our any codeword/prefix of a codeword; thus we know that the correct decoding must be 0011 -> A.

### Problem 2
Suppose that all character frequencies are equal. Describe any interesting features of the resulting Huffman code.

**Ans**: *There are probably more interesting features I didn't notice, but here are a couple:*
- If the number of characters is a power of 2 (call this 2^b^), the resulting codewords are all of equal length, and encompass all length-b binary bitstrings.
- The Huffman encoding is not unique--it depends on how you merge equal-weight nodes (but any encoding is optimal).
