# 20. Hashing
## Overview
### DataIndexedSet
- brute force: treat key as number (array index)
- extremely wasteful of memory
### Hashing
- represent key by smaller value using `hashCode()` -> integer
### HashCode and Indices
- can't `%` because may be negative
- can't `abs` because Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) negative
- soln: `hashCode & 0x7FFFFFFF`
### Hash Fx
- converts key -> value btwn 0 and M - 1
- call .hashCode, set sign bit to 0, take mod
### Good Hash Functions
- use all bits in the key
- if known and easy to invert, can always design "bad" sequence of inputs
### Uniform Hashing
- assume hash function distributes evenly
- never satisfied in practice
### Separate Chaining
- each index stores linked list of Nodes (key-value pairs)
- hash function -> specific linked list -> scan that list
### Resizing
- resizing moves objects between buckets
- constant M : N proportion (LF bounded by constant)
### Performance
- amortized search/insert is N/M, which is constant
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
 Is the following implementation of hashCode() legal?
```java
 public int hashCode() {
     return 17;
 }
```
**Ans**: Legal but bad, since all objects will hash to the same bucket, resulting in linear performance.
## B Level
### Problem 1
[Problem 2](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hx9h4t96ea8qv/h32s1vxe6mb5o0/i7vkubmrxjn0/fa14_mt2.pdf)  of the Fall 2014 midterm.

## A Level
### Problem 1
One strategy discussed in class for hashing objects containing multiple pieces of data is as follows (in pseudocode), where  `x.get(i)`  returns the i-th piece of data in  `x`.
```java
int hashCode = 0;
 for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i += 1) {
    hashCode *= R;
    hashCode += x.get(i).hashCode();
    hashCode = hashCode % M;
 }
 return hashCode;
```
Effectively, weâ€™re summing each piece of data multiplied by a different power of R. In class, we used R = 31, and M is the number of buckets. Explain why the idea above does not work well if M = 31 (or some power of 31).

**Ans**: If M = 31, then only the last piece of whatever object you're hashing will actually get used in the hashcode. Suppose some object has multiple parts, each with hashCode $x_1, x_2, ... x_n$.

Before the first iteration, `hashCode` is 0.

After iteration 1, `hashCode` is $x_1$.

In iteration 2:
`hashCode *= 31` --> $31x_1$
`hashCode += x.get(i).hashCode();` --> $31x_1 + x_2$
`hashCode = hashCode % 31;` --> $x_2$ 

This continues for each item in the collection, and the final hashcode is just $x_n$. We are not utilizing all components of the object, which will cause many collisions (it's similar to just using the last letter of a String to compute its hashcode).

### Problem 2
If we start with a hash table of size 2 and double when the load factor exceeds some constant. Why is this procedure for setting sizes suboptimal from the perspective of utilizing all of the bits of the hashCode?

**Ans**: Modding by a power of 2 (call this $2^k$) removes all but the last $k$ bits of the number. Thus, we are not utilizing all the bits of the hashcode which will reult in more collisions. 

### Problem 3
Suppose that we hash strings as described in A-level problem 1, using R = 256 and M = 255. Show that any permutation of letters within a string hashes to the same value. Why is this a bad thing?

**Ans**: Let's suppose each letter of the string has letter with hashcodes $x_1x_2x_3...x_n$.
By properties of mod, taking the modulo of each component of a sum is the same as taking the mod of the entire sum. Thus, let's first compute the entire hashcode without modding.
hashcode = $256^nx_1 + 256^{n-1}x_2 + ... 256x_{n-1}+ x_{n}$
`hashCode%255` = $256^nx_1 + 256^{n-1}x_2 + ... 256x_{n-1}+ x_{n} \mod 255$

$256^k * x_i \mod 255$ for any $k, i$ is just $x_i$ 
because $256 * 256 * 256 * ... * x_i \mod 255 =$
$(256 \mod 255) * (256 \mod 255) * ... (x_i \mod 255) =$
$1 * 1 * ... (x_i \mod 255) = x_i \mod 255$

Thus `hashCode%255` = $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n \mod 255$
You can permute the original expression for `hashCode` in any order and still get the above expression.

### Problem 4
Find 2 strings in Java that hash to the same value (writing code is probably best).

*Note: this only finds 2-letter strings, for simplicity. Also, this is very ugly, so please contact me if you come up with a bettter solution*
```java
public static void sameHashStrings() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < 256; j++) {
			for (int k = 0; k < 256; k++) {
				for (int m  = 0; m < 256; m++) {
					char c1 = (int) i;
					char c2 = (int) j;
					char c3 = (int) k;
					char c4 = (int) m;
					String s1 = c1 + c2;
					String s2 = c3 + c4;
					if (s1.hashCode() == s2.hashCode()) {
						System.out.println(c1 + " " + c2);
						return;
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Problem 6
Explan why the approach in A-level question 1 works better if we initially start the hashCode at 1 instead of 0.
**Ans**: It's not (confirmed by Josh Hug himself).

## A+ Level
### Problem 1
Give a simple procedure that can be carried out by hand that takes a Java string X and finds another Java string Y with the same hashCode().

**Ans**: For any 2-letter string, you can find a string with the same `hashCode` by using a similar approach to problem 4 in the A-level problems above. Thus, you can simply take every 2 letters of X and replace them with a 2-letter string with equivalent hashcode to construct Y.
