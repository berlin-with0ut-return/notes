# 8. Inheritance, Implements
## Overview
### Overloading
- methods w/ same name but diff params
	- ex: `Math` `add(int a, int b)` and `add(float a, float b)`
	- compiler chooses based on params
### Generalizing Code
- repeating code makes it hard to maintain
- define reference type to represent multiple related types 
	- ex: `List61B` -> `AList`, `SLList`
### Interfaces
- `interface` specifies what a class does but not how
	- ex: `public Item get(int i)`
- to specify is-a rlsp, use `implements`
### Overriding
- `@Override` is good style and prevents typos (compiler check)
### Interface Inheritance
- subclasses inherit from superclasses
- interfaces contain method signatures which are implemented by subclasses
- multigeneration: C -> B - > A...
### Default Methods
- implemented inside interface, can use other interface methods
- must work for any object implementing interface!
- subclasses can call without reimplementing, but can also override
### Static vs. Dynamic Types
- static type: specified during declaration, checked atcompilation
- dynamic type: specified during instantiation, checked at runtime
```java
Thing a;
a = new Fox(); // static: Thing, dynamic: Fox
```
```java
Animal b = a; // OK: Fox is an Animal
Fox c = (Fox) b; // OK: Fox is a Fox and b points to a Fox
a = new Squid(); // OK: Squid is a Thing
```
### DMS
- if static type X and dynamic type Y:
	- if Y overrides method from X:
		- at runtime, use the method in class Y
### Overloading + DMS
- DMS is NOT involved in overloading!
```java
Fox f = new Fox();
Animal a = f;
define(f); // executes define1
define(a); // executes define2
```
```java
1 public static void define(Fox f) { ... }
2 public static void define(Animal a) { ... }
```
