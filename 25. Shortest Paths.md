# 25. Shortest Paths
## Overview
### Dijkstra's
- gives shortest paths from src -> every other vertex
	- can also do with BFS if edge weights are equal
- SPT stored as edgeTo, distTo
- algorithm: visit each vertex in order of sitance from source, and relax
```
Dijkstra(G, s):
    while not every vertex has been visited:
        visit(unmarked vertex v for which distTo(v) is minimized)
visit(v):
    mark(v)
    for each edge e of s:
        relax(e)
relax(e):
    v = e.source
    w = e.target        
    currentBestKnownWeight = distTo(w)
    possiblyBetterWeight = distTo(v) + e.weight
    if possiblyBetterWeight < currentBestKnownWeight
        Use e instead of whatever we were using before
```
- runtime: O(v log V + V log V + E log V) ~ O(E log V) since most often E > V
### A* Shortest Paths
- for path to single target, Dijkstra's inefficient (explore edges in wrong direction)
- visit in order of source + heuristic(v)
```
A*(G, s):
    while not every vertex has been visited:
        visit(unmarked vertex v for which distTo(v) + h(v) is minimized)
```
- if h(v) < true distance(s, v), then result of A* always correct
