# 3. References, Recursion, and Lists
## Overview
### Bits
- info as memory as seqs of bits (0/1)
### Primitives
- byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char
	- each has certain # of bits
- to declare primitive, set aside memory space for bits + map memory name
### Creating Objects
- using `new`: boxes of bits for each field, based on type
	- sets to defaults
- ex: Walrus with `int` and `double` -> 32 + 64 = 96 bits
- constructor returns memory location of boxes, stored in var with ref type
### Ref Types
- any non-primitive type
- refer to location of memory of object, 64 bits
### GRoE
- assignment copies bits
	- primitives copies values, ref copies addresses
- same for param passing
### Arrays
- arrays are objects, instantiated w/ new
- declararing creates reference type to null
	- `new` creates array + returns memory location
### IntLists
- recursively defined, can change size
- iterative + recursive methods
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
**Exercise 2.1.1**: Suppose we have the code below:
```java
public class PassByValueFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
           Walrus walrus = new Walrus(3500, 10.5);
           int x = 9;

           doStuff(walrus, x);
           System.out.println(walrus);
           System.out.println(x);
    }

    public static void doStuff(Walrus W, int x) {
           W.weight = W.weight - 100;
           x = x - 5;
    }
}
```
Does the call to  `doStuff`  have an effect on walrus and/or x?

**Ans**: `doStuff` changes `walrus` 's weight to 3400. `x` in `main` does not change.

**Exercise**: Write a method  `get(int i)`  that returns the ith item of the list. For example, if  `L`  is 5 -> 10 -> 15, then  `L.get(0)`  should return 5,  `L.get(1)`  should return 10, and  `L.get(2)`  should return 15. It doesn't matter how your code behaves for invalid  `i`, either too big or too small.

**Ans**:
```java
public int get(int i) {
	if (i == 0) {
		return first;
	}
	return rest.get(i - 1);
}
```
### Problem 2
If doubles are more versatile than ints, why donâ€™t we always use them? Are there any disadvantages to doing this?

**Ans**: Doubles use more memory than ints (twice as much). Also, doubles have finite precision, which can lead to rounding errors. There are some places where using a double doesn't make sense, such as array indices.
### Problem 3
How much does the memory cost differ between the storing of an address of a 32 entry int array and a 300 entry int array?

**Ans**: 8576 bit difference
memory cost of 32-entry int array: 64 (address) + 32 * 32 (items) = 1088
memory cost of 300-entry int array: 64 (address) + 32 * 300 = 9664
## B Level
### Problem 1
Rewrite the size, iterativeSize, and get methods from lecture by using the [starter code ](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/lectureCode-sp18/blob/master/exercises/lists1/IntList.java) for the IntList class.
```java
public class IntList {
	public int first;
	public IntList rest;

	public IntList(int f, IntList r) {
		first = f;
		rest = r;
	}

	/** Return the size of the list using... recursion! */
	public int size() {
		if (rest == null) {
			return 1;
		}
		return rest.size() + 1;
	}

	/** Return the size of the list using no recursion! */
	public int iterativeSize() {
		int total = 0;
		IntList p = this;
		while (p != null) {
			p = p.rest;
			total += 1;
		}
		return total;
	}

	/** Returns the ith value in this list.*/
	public int get(int i) {
		if (i == 0) {
			return first;
		}
		return rest.get(i - 1);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		IntList L = new IntList(15, null);
		L = new IntList(10, L);
		L = new IntList(5, L);

		System.out.println(L.iterativeSize());
	}
} 
```
