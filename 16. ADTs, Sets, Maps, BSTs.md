# 16. ADTs, Sets, Maps, BSTs
## Overview
### ADTs
- ADT ~ interface: defined by operations, not implementation
- abstraction not tied to language (ex: List)
### Trees
- set of nodes + edges
- only 1 path btwn any 2 nodes, no cycles
- rooted trees: every node except root has 1 parent
	- root has no parents, leaves have no children
### BSTs
- rooted binary tree: for node X, everything to left is smaller, everything to right is larger
- search by comparing to current node
- runtime: O(log N) for bushy trees, O(N) for spindly
	- based on height
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
What is the best case BST height in terms of N? Worst case?

**Ans**: Best case is lgN, worst case is N - 1.
### Problem 2
If shuffling yields logN tree height (with extremely high probability), why don’t we simply shuffle our input data before building our BST based symbol table to avoid worst case behavior?

**Ans**: see [here](https://us.edstem.org/courses/979/discussion/150227).
### Problem 3
Give two orderings of the keys A X C S E R H that, when inserted into an empty BST, yield the best case height. Draw the tree.

**Ans**: In sorted order, the keys are A C E H R S X. Continuously pick the median of each half to be the next inserted.
Two possible orderings: HCSAERX, HSCRXAE. Both result in the tree below. Any ordering with H first, C before A/E, and S before R/X is correct.

### Problem 4
Delete the root from the tree you created for question 3.

Using E, the inorder predecessor, is also correct.
## B Level
### Problem 1
Suppose that a certain BST has keys that are integers between 1 and 10, and we search for 5. Which sequence(s) of keys below are possible during the search for 5?

a. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5: Yes, spindly BST.

b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 5: es, this is a valid BST.

c. 1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 6, 5: Yes, this is a valid BST.

d. 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5: No, after you move to the left of 7 you can never see anything larger than it again.

e. 1, 2, 10, 4, 8, 5: es, this is a valid BST.

### Problem 2
Give an example of something that you might like to store as a key in a symbol table for which there is no natural compare method.

**Ans**: Consider the Dog class from earlier in lecture. There's no natural order for Dogs--they can be ordered by name, or weight, or breed name, etc.

### Problem 3
Do there exist any objects for which it is impossible to define a total order? In other words, can we always write a compare method if we’re willing to do the work, or are some data types fundamentally impossible to compare other than for equality?

**Ans**: We can always define some kind of arbitrary ordering by  hashing the object and comparing their hashcodes in worst case. 

*Note: I don't really like this answer. If you have a better answer please let me know.*

### Problem 4
When we delete from a BST, we always chose either the predecessor or successor as a replacement for the root. We said that these two items always have zero or one children. Why?

**Ans**: Suppose the predecessor (call this P) had 2 children. Then its left child is less than it, and thus P is not the predecessor. This is a contradiction; thus P cannot have 2 children. A similar proof follows for the successor.

### Problem 5
Is the delete operation commutative? In other words, if we delete x, then y, do we always get the same tree as if we delete y, then x?

**Ans**: No. Consider the following tree and deleting 5, 3 vs. deleting 3, 5 (assuming we use the predecessor in Hibbard deletion).
