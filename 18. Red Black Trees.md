# 18. Red Black Trees
## Overview
### Tree Rotations
- rotateLeft or rotateRight is still valid BST
### LLRBs
- one-to-one correspondence with 2-3 tree
- red links indicate same node in 2-3 tree
- rules:
	- red edges always to left
	- no node ever has 2 red links
	- ever path from root to leaf has same number of black links (black balanced)
		- since all leaves in 2-3 tree have same depth
### LLRB Operations
- left leaning red link: rotate left
- 2 consecutive left links: rotate top node right
- 2 red children: flip colors
*Note: no exercises*
