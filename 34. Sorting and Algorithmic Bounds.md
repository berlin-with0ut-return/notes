# 34. Sorting and Algorithmic Bounds
## Overview
### Bounds
$N! \in \Omega((N/2)^{N/2})$
$log(N!) \in \Omega(N log N)$ and $N log N \in \Omega(log(N!))$, so $log(N!) \in \Theta(N log N)$
### Sorting Lower Bounds
- most sorts have lower bound Θ(N log N)
- suppose TUCS = fastest comparison sort
- TUCS worst case: O(N log N), since existing sorts have worst case runtime Θ(N log N)
- TUCS best case: Ω(N), since have to examine every item
### PCD
- for 3 items, 6 permutations -> need ceil(lg(6)) questions to resolve.
- sorting is one way to solve PCD
	- thus lower bound on PCD comparisons = lower bound on sorting comparisons
- N items -> N! permutations -> lg(N!) questions
	- log(N!) is Θ(N log N), so TUCS must have at least Ω(N log N) comparisons
- no (comparison-based) sorting algorithm does better
# Exercises
## C Level
Problem 3  [from my Fall 2014 midterm](http://datastructur.es/sp16/materials/exam/CS61B_Fall2014_MT2.pdf).
[solution](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/test-solutions/test2-soln.pdf).
## B Level
Make sure that you understand exactly why I chose Ω, Θ, and O in “Seeking a Sorting Lower Bound” and “Establishing a Sorting Lower Bound” above.

**Ans**: Breakdown of each bound below.
TUCS $\in O(N log N)$ because we assume TUCS is the fastest comparison-based sorting algorithm. The best sorting algorithms (mergesort for example) have Θ(N log N) runtime in the worst case, thus TUCS must also run in N log N or better (otherwise it wouldn't be the best sorting algorithm, since it would be worse than mergesort).
TUCS $\in \Omega(N)$ because in a comparison-based sort, you have to look at every item at least once. Otherwise you would have unexamined items left over and not know where those belong in your sorting order.
TUCS $\in \Omega(N log N)$ based on PCD. This is because PCD requires at least Θ(N log N) questions--you can think of Θ(N log N) as a lower bound on the best-case runtime of solving PCD. That means *anything* that solves PCD cannot do better than Θ(N log N). TUCS is one way of solving PCD, so it is also lower-bounded by this runtime.

### Problem 3
Hug and Hilfinger's [Fall 2014 midterm, problem 6](http://datastructur.es/sp16/materials/exam/CS61B_Fall2014_MT2.pdf).
[solution](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/test-solutions/test2-soln.pdf).
### Problem 4
Answer the questions from the  [Sounds of Sorting lecture slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XdAjNsqYRDLqOpgUeGmPSTT0EmvnXppBSmgTNPME1Qc/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g4671a419d_07).

How many items for selection sort?
**Ans**: Selection sort makes N comparisons in the first pass to find the minimum, then swaps that to the front. Now there are N - 1 items left, then N - 2, then N - 3, and so on. Using the formula N + (N - 1) + (N - 2) + ... 1, we get that selection sort makes $(N)(N - 1)/2$ comparisons.
(N)(N - 1)/2 = 7875 comparisons from the video, so N = 126 items.

Why does insertion sort take longer / more compares than selection sort?
*Note: seems like a dumb answer but...*
**Ans**: Because there are more items in the insertion sort... (you can see that the bars are much thinner and there are more of them). Conceptually this makes sense too because insertion sort makes less compares than selection sort in all cases.

At what time stamp does the first partition complete for Quicksort?
**Ans**: 40 seconds - when the two red bars meet (this corresponds to the L/R pointers crossing in Hoare partitioning).

Could the size of the input to mergesort be a power of 2?
**Ans**: If the input to mergesort is a power of 2, then the subproblems will be of size N, N/2, N/4 ... 4, 2, 1--in other words every merge should have an exactly equal number of items. We can see from the video that the merges are not necessarily the same size, thus the input cannot be a power of 2.
Another way to figure this out: the number of comparisons for mergesort is $n \lceil lg~n \rceil + 2^{\lceil lg~n\rceil} + 1$; solving this gives you n = 608.

What do the colors mean for heapsort?
**Ans**: The levels of the heap.
## A Level
### Problem 1
Find the optimal decision tree for playing puppy, cat, dog, walrus.
*Note: this took me literally 2 hours of guess-and-check*

Red represents false, green represens true.
