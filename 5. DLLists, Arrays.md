# 5. DLLists, Arrays
## Overview
### SLList Drawbacks
- `addLast` slow: must loop to back before adding
- one soln: cache `last`
	- problem: doesn't work if you removeLast
### DLList
- each node has `prev` pointer (doubly linked)
- adding/removing from back and front fast
### DLList Sentinels
- option 1: one front, one back
- option 2: circular, sentinel.next = first item of list, sentinel.prev = last item of list
	- last item's `next` is sentinel, first item's `prev` is sentinel
	- empty list: sentinel next and prev is self
### Generic Lists
- add type parameter `<T>`
- pass type during instantiation (ex: `DLList<String>`)
### Arrays
- arrays are numbered seqs of boxes of bits
- same type, constant length
- to get ith item: `A[i]` (from 0 to N - 1)
- no methods, one length variable
### Array Instantiation
- default vals: `int[] y = new int[3]`
- specific vals: 
	- `int[] x = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
	- `int[] w = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- set vals with indexing (ex: `A[3] = 4`)
- `arraycopy(Object src, int srcPos, Object dest, int destPos, int length)`
### 2D Arrays
- `int[][] arr = new int[4][]` -> manually create inner arrays `arr[0] = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4};`
- default inner arrays: `int[][] a = new int[4][4]`
### Arrays vs. Classes
- both organize memory, have fixed boxes
- access: array = square brackets, classes = dot notation
- elem: array = same type, class = any type
- array indices computed at runtime, class member variable names are not
## Exercises
### Problem 1
Complete the exercises from the online textbook  [here](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/chap23.html)  and  [here](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/chap24.html).

![sllist_last_pointer.png](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/fig23/sllist_last_pointer.png)

**Exercise 2.3.1:**  Consider the box and pointer diagram representing the  `SLList`  implementation above, which includes the last pointer. Suppose that we'd like to support  `addLast`,  `getLast`, and  `removeLast`  operations. Will the structure shown support rapid  `addLast`,  `getLast`, and  `removeLast`  operations? If not, which operations are slow?

**Ans**: `removeLast` (no easy way to get second-to-last node)

**Exercise 2.3.2:**  Try to devise a scheme for speeding up the  `removeLast`  operation so that it always runs in constant time, no matter how long the list.

**Ans**: use a doubly-linked list (`prev` and `next` pointers)

**Exercise 2.4.1:**  After running the code below, what will be the values of `x[0][0]` and `w[0][0]`? Check your work by clicking  [here](http://goo.gl/fCZ9Dr).
```java
int[][] x = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};

int[][] z = new int[3][];
z[0] = x[0];
z[1] = x[1];
z[2] = x[2];
z[0][0] = -z[0][0];

int[][] w = new int[3][3];
System.arraycopy(x[0], 0, w[0], 0, 3);
System.arraycopy(x[1], 0, w[1], 0, 3);
System.arraycopy(x[2], 0, w[2], 0, 3);
w[0][0] = -w[0][0];
```

**Ans**: `x[0][0] = -1`, `w[0][0] = 1`

### Problem 2
Can you create a 2 dimensional array with different types? For example, one sub array would be composed of all Strings and another sub array would be made of only ints.

**Ans**: ![enter image description here](https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&v=2&jpgQuality=100&width=700&url=https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/028/596/dsmGaKWMeHXe9QuJtq_ys30PNfTGnMsRuHuo_MUzGCg.jpg)
You can't declare an 2D array with different types, but you could declare `Object[][]` and place different Object types inside.

### Problem 1
At each step follow the instructions
```java
public class Deck{
    public static  int[] cards;
    Deck(){
        cards = [1, 3, 4, 10];
    }
}
```
Write down the contents of dingie’s array cards.
```java
Deck dingie = new Deck();
dingie.cards[3] = 3; // [1, 3, 4, 3]
```
Write the contents of pilates’s array and dingie’s array.
```java
Deck pilates = new Deck(); // constructor "resets" array!
pilates.cards[1] = 2; // both [1, 2, 4, 10]
```
Write the contents of pilates’s array and dingie’s array.
```java
int[] newArrWhoDis = {2, 2, 4, 1, 3};
dingie.cards = pilates.cards;
pilates.cards = newArrWhoDis;
newArrWhoDis = null; // both [2, 2, 4, 1, 3]
```

### Problem 2
Say we have a 2 dimensional DList. We want this 2-D DList to be as even as possible. To do this we will try to fill up rows as uniformly as possible- meaning that not row will have a greater size than any other row by more than 1 element. Write a method that will take in a sub DList and add the given element if it fulfills the constraints. If the constraints are not fulfilled, the item will be attempted to be put in the DList below the one you attempted to insert in originally and so forth until the bottom most DList is reached in which case move to the top DList.
```java
public static void insert2D(int[][] arr, int subIndex, int item) {
	int minLength = minSize(arr);
	int i = subIndex;
	while (arr[i].length > minLength) {
		i = Math.floorMod(i + 1, arr.length);
	}
	int[] added = new int[minLength + 1];
	System.arraycopy(arr[i], 0, added, 0, minLength);
	added[minLength] = item;
	arr[i] = added;
}

/** Returns the index of the array of minimum length in a 2D array.
  * ARR must have length >= 1.
  */
private static int minSize(int[][] arr) {
	int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
	for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		minLength = Math.min(arr[i].length, minLength);
	}
	return minLength; 
}
```
