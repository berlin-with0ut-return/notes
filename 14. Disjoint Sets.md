# 14. Disjoint Sets
## Overview
### Alg Dev
- model problem, develop alg, and revise
### Dynamic Connectivity
- `connect(int p, int q)` and `isConnected(int p, int q)`
	- or `find(int p) == find(int q)` for connectivity
### Connectivity and Equivalence
- equivalence relation: every object in one bucket, check if 2 are in same bucket
### QuickFind
- give each object a number in `id[]`
- `connect`: set every p's bucket to q's bucket, Θ(N)
- `isConnected`: constant
### QuickUnion
- `id[i]` is parent of `i` (root: parent is itself), Θ(N) for root finding
- `connect`: root of p = root of q, Θ(N) for root finding
### WQU
- when connecting, connect root of smaller tree to larger root (by size)
- tree height is `lg N`, so `connect` and `isConnected` are lg N
### WQUPC
- when find called, set every node along path to have parent root
- trees become flat
- M calls to union + N calls to find: O(M log* N) (log* << 5)

*Note: any tree with a similar structure is fine, due to arbitrary tie-breaking*

### Problem 3
For the `WeightedQuickUnionUF` data structure, the runtime of the `union` and `connected` operations is O(logN). Suppose we create a `WeightedQuickUnionUF` object with N items and then perform $M_U$ and $M_C$ union and connected operations, give the runtime in big O notation.
**Ans**: $O(M_UlogN + M_ClogN + N)$ 
(union + connect + array creation)
### Problem 4
Same as #3, but give an example of a sequence of operations for which the runtime is  $O(N+M_U+M_C)$.
**Ans**: just connect roots continuously, or connect the same vertex to itself.
### Problem 5
```java
 public void connect(int p, int q) {
     if (connected(p, q)) return;

     // Rename p’s component to q’s name.
     for (int i = 0; i < id.length; i++) {
         if (id[i] == id[p]) id[i] = id[q];
     }
     count -= 1;
 }
```
**Ans**: No, you mutate id[p] so everything after the pth element is will not be updated since it no longer == id[p].

## A Level
### Problem 1
In weighted quick-union, suppose that we set id[find(p)] to q instead of id[find(q)]. Would the resulting algorithm be correct?

**Ans**: It would be correct, but you would no longer have log height (since you're connecting the root to q rather than the root of q).

### Problem 2
If we’re concerned about tree height, why don’t we use height for deciding tree size instead of weight? What is the worst-case tree height for weighted-quick-union vs. heighted-quick-union? What is the average tree height?

**Ans**: Heighted quick union is much more complex to implement, and they have the same worst-case and average-case performance: Θ(log N) in terms of tree height.

### Problem 3
[Problem 3](https://tbp.berkeley.edu/exams/6137/download/)  from Spring 2018 midterm #2

### Problem 4
Try writing weighted-quick-union-with-path-compression without looking at the code on the booksite. 
*Note: the only change is to the find method. Other methods are ommited for brevity*
```java
public int find(int p) {
	ArrayList<Integer> visited = new ArrayList<>();
	while (id[p] != p) {
		visited.add(p);
		p = id[p];
	}
	for (int v : visited) {
		id[v] = p;
	}
	return p;
}
```
