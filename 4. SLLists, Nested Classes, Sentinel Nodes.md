# 4. SLLists, Nested Classes, Sentinel Nodes
## Overview
### Naked Data Structures
- `IntLists` hard to use: all operations recursive
- fix: turn `IntList` into `IntNode` + create wrapper class `SLList`
	- `SLList` has `IntNode first`
### Using SLList
- user calls `SLList` constructor which calls `IntList` methods and changes `first`
- `SLList` mediates btwn user/naked `IntList`
### Public vs. Private
- `private` prevents users from modifying
	- other classes cannot modify; code within file can
### Nested Classes
- classes inside classes; can be private
- if nested class doesn't use instance vars, make it static
### Recursive Helper Methods
- `SLList` not naturally recursive: write outer method for users, which calls private recursive `IntNode` method
### Caching
- use wrapper class to store vals (like `size`)
### Empty Lists
- option 1: `first = null`, `size = 0`
	- problem: causes `NullPointerExceptions`
	- can write special code, or use...
- sentinel nodes: always present, sentinel.next is actual list elems
### Invariants
- property of data structure guaranteed to be true
- ex: `SLList` with sentinel
	- sentinel reference always points to sentinel node
	- sentinel.next.item is first item
	- size = number of items added
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
**Exercise 2.2.1**: Try to write an  `addFirst`  method to the  `IntList`  class. You'll find that the resulting method is tricky as well as inefficient.
```java
public void addFirst(int x) {
	IntList p = this;
	int prev = x;
	while (p.rest != null) {
		int next = p.first;
		p.first = prev;
		prev = next;
		p = p.rest;
	}
	p.rest = new IntList(prev, null);
}
```
**Exercise 2.2.2**  Delete the word  `static`  as few times as possible so that  [this program](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/exercises/Government.java)  compiles.
```java
public class Government {
	private int treasury = 5;

	private void spend() {
		treasury -= 1;
	}

	private void tax() {
		treasury += 1;
	}

	public void report() {
		System.out.println(treasury);
	}

	public static Government greaterTreasury(Government a, Government b) {
		if (a.treasury > b.treasury) {
			return a;
		}
		return b;
	}

	public static class Peasant {
		public void doStuff() {
			System.out.println("hello");			
		}
	}

	public class King { // delete
		public void doStuff() {
			spend();			
		}
	}

	public class Mayor { // delete
		public void doStuff() {
			tax();			
		}
	}

	public class Accountant { // delete
		public void doStuff() {
			report();			
		}
	}

	public class Thief { // delete
		public void doStuff() {
			treasury = 0;			
		}
	}

	public static class Explorer {
		public void doStuff(Government a, Government b) {
			Government favorite = Government.greaterTreasury(a, b);
			System.out.println("The best government has treasury " + favorite.treasury);			
		}
	}
}
```
**Exercise 2.2.3**  Fix the  `addLast`  method. Starter code  [here](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/lectureCode/blob/master/lists2/DIY/fixAddLast/SLList.java).
```java
public void addLast(int x) {
    size += 1;
    IntNode p = sentinel; // use a sentinel node
    while (p.next != null) {
        p = p.next;
    }
    p.next = new IntNode(x, null);
}
```
### Problem 2
Reexplain what the sentinel node is and why it’s important. Ask yourself if your code would error if you removed the sentinel. Is the sentinel a necessary component of your IntList?

**Ans**: While the sentinel node is not necessary, it simplifies code by removing the need for special cases for the empty list. If the sentinel was removed, we would need to add null checks to every single method or there would be a NullPointerException when our list is empty.
### Problem 3
What is the downside of not having a size variable and rather just calculating the size each time?

**Ans**: Calculating the size each time takes linear time, since you have to traverse through the list (while returning the `size` variable is constant time).
## B Level
### Problem 1
Starting from the copy of SLList.java provided to you in the lecture code repository, implement the method `deleteFirst`, which deletes the first element in your SLList.
```java
public void deleteFirst() {
	if (sentinel.next == null) {
		return;
	}
	sentinel.next = sentinel.next.next;
	size -= 1;
}
```
### Problem 2
Starting from the copy of SLList.java provided to you in the lecture code repository, implement a second constructor that takes in an array of integers, and creates an SLList with those integers. Again, remember to maintain your invariants.
```java
public SLList(int[] items) {
	sentinel = new IntNode(69, null);
	size = 0;
	IntNode p = sentinel;
	for (int i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
		p.next = new IntNode(items[i], null);
		p = p.next;
		size += 1;
	}
}
```
### Problem 3
If the sentinel node was a null node, would it change anything or would the Intlist be able to function?

**Ans**: The value of the sentinel does not matter; it doesn't affect the functioning of the IntList. However, in this case, `sentinel` is an IntNode which can only hold `int` values, so the sentinel would not be able to hold `null` as its value.
## A Level
### Problem 1
We want to add a method to IntList so that if 2 numbers in a row are the same, we add them together and make one large node. For example:
1 → 1 → 2 → 3 becomes 2 → 2 → 3 which becomes 4 → 3
```java
public void addAdjacent() {
	IntList p = this;
	while (p != null && p.rest != null) {
		if (p.first = p.rest.first) {
			p.first *= 2;
			p.rest = p.rest.rest;
		} else {
			p = p.rest;
		}
	}
}
```
### Problem 2
Modify the Intlist class so that every time you add a value you “square” the IntList. For example, upon the insertion of 5, the below IntList would transform from:

1 => 2 to 1 => 1 => 2 => 4 => 5

and if 7 was added to the latter IntList, it would become

1 => 1 => 1 => 1 => 2 => 4 => 4 => 16 => 5 => 25 => 7

Additionally, you are provided the constraint that you can only access the size() function one time during the entire process of adding a node.
```java
public void addAndSquare(int x) {
      if (rest == null) {
         rest = new IntList(first * first, new IntList(x, null));
         return;
      }
      IntList temp = rest;
      rest = new IntList(first * first, null);
      rest.rest = temp;
      temp.addAndSquare(x);
}
```
