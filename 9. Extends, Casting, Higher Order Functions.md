# 9. Extends, Casting, Higher Order Functions
## Overview
### Interfaces
- allow redudant code for similar classes
- interface: `implements`, inherit: `extends`
### Using Inheritance
- static/instance vars, all methods, nested classes are inherited
	- except private, constructor
### Constructors
- explicitly call with `super()` (also already implicit)
	- constructors with args not implicitly called!
```java
public VengefulSLList() {
  //super(); implicit
  deletedItems = new SLList<Item>();
}
```
```java
public VengefulSLList() {
    super(x); // must call
    deletedItems = new SLList<Item>();
  }
```
### Is-A Rlsps
- class inheriting from another means it must have all the properties of the superclass
- all classes are Objects
### Abstraction
- hiding components of programs: use methods without knowing implementation
### Casting
- each object has static (compile) type + dynamic (runtime) type
	- dynamic is allowed to be more specific than static
```java 
Poodle frank  = new Poodle("Frank", 5);
Poodle frankJr = new Poodle("Frank Jr.", 15);
Dog largerDog = maxDog(frank, frankJr); // ok!
Poodle largerPoodle = maxDog(frank, frankJr); // compile error
```
- casting forces static type, does NOT affect dynamic type
```java
Poodle largerPoodle = (Poodle) maxDog(frank, frankJr);
```
- casting has problems! must ensure correct type
	- can always cast up (ex: all Poodles are Dogs)
	- can cast down carefully (ex: sometimes Dogs are Poodles)
	- NEVER cast to class that is not superclass/subclass (not in direct lineage)
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
Do the problems from [lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Ac0Xrd1sVA5_YSqPe6HdvD7DIhX2t4R6O-eQ3W6VBQ/edit#slide=id.g4f54a83fc15915b9538)
```java
ShowDog dogC = new ShowDog("Franklin", "Malamute", 180, 6);
ShowDog dogD = new ShowDog("Gargamel", "Corgi", 44, 12);
Dog.maxDog(dogC, dogD);
```
1. What is the static type of Dog.maxDog(dogC, dog D)?
**Ans**: Dog (based on the return type).

2. Identify if each line will compile.
```java
Dog md = Dog.maxDog(dogC, dogD); // compiles
ShowDog msd = Dog.maxDog(dogC, dogD); // doesn't compile
```
3. How many memory boxes are there in the code below? What are the dynamic types of their contents?
```java
Object o = new Dog("Hammy", "Beagle", 15);
Dog d = new Dog("Ammo", "Laborador", 54);
Object[] stuff = new Object[5];
stuff[0] = o
stuff[1] = d;
stuff[2] = null;
```

### Problem 2
Is it possible for an interface to extend a class? 

**Ans**: It doesn't make sense for an interface to extend a class since interfaces don't implement methods. Extending from a superclass means that subclass must have the same functionality as the superclass, but interfaces don't really have any "functionality" to speak of.
### Problem 3
What are the differences between inheritance through classes and interfaces? Is there a particular time when you would want to use one over the other?

**Ans**: Classes implement methods (they specify *what* and *how*); interfaces specify only what methods inheriting classes have (*how* only). You might use interface inheritance when  you want to completely implement the functionality of a class from scratch. Using class inheritance might be better when you're adding only a few methods or attributes on top of an existing class. 
Also, as a side note, interfaces support multiple inheritance while classes do not.
## B Level
### Problem 1
Say there is a class Poodle that inherits from Dog. The Dog class looks like this
```java
 public class Dog{
     int weight;
     public Dog(int weight_in_pounds) {
       weight = weight_in_pounds;
     }
   }
```
And the Poodle class looks like this.
```java
 public class Poodle extends Dog{
   public Poodle() {}
 }
```
Is this valid? If so explain why Poodle is a Dog if Dog has no constructor with no argument. If it is not valid then explain how we can make it valid.

**Ans**: Classes in Java only have an implicit 0-argument constructor if *no other constructor is present*. As such, this is invalid--the Poodle() constructor will implicitly call `super()`, but Dog has no 0-argument constructor, so this will error. To make this valid, add a new `public Dog()` constructor.
### Problem 2
The  `Monkey`  class is a subclass of the  `Animal`  class and the  `Dog`  class is a subclass of the  `Animal`  class. However a Dog is not a Monkey nor is a Monkey a Dog. What will happen for the following code? Assume that the constructors are all formatted properly.
```java
     Monkey jimmy = new Monkey("Jimmy"); // OK
     Dog limmy = (Dog) jimmy; // CE: cannot "side-cast"
```
```java 
 Monkey orangutan = new Monkey("fruitful"); // OK
 Dog mangotan = (Dog)(Animal) orangutan; // RE: Monkey cannot be cast to Dog
```
