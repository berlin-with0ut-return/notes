# 19. Range Searching and Multi-Dimensional Data
## Overview
### Set Operations
- `select(int i)` for ith smallest
- `subset(T from, T to)`: all items between from and to
- `nearest(T x)`: closest to X
- easy on 1D data, but harder on 2D
### Quadtrees
- 4 neighbors: NW, NE, SW, SE
- prune non-useful branches during query
### KDTrees
- normal BST with alternating levels
- efficient pruning

*Note: no exercises*
