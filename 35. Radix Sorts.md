# 35. Radix Sorts
## Overview
### Terminology
- radix: base in base-N number system
- radix sort: uses one character/digit at time
### Counting Sort
- sort N keys that takes on int values btwn 0, R - 1
- Θ(N + R) time
	- lower than linearithmic because no comparisons
### LSD
- sort by digit right -> left
- Θ(WN) digits examined, Θ(WR) to create R-length arrays for counting sort
	- Θ(WN + WR) runtime
	- Θ(WN) if R is thought of as constant
- counting sort doesn't have to be subroutine
### LSD vs. Comparison Sort
- Θ(N log N) sorts can still be faster than Θ(WN)
- LSd is better for larger Ns
### MSD
- left -> right, up to R subproblems
- worst case: Θ(WN + WR) to look at all characters
- best case: Θ(N + R) to look at top character only
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
For a fixed alphabet and key size, what are the best case and worst case inputs for LSD? For MSD?

For LSD, there's not really any best or worst-case outcomes; the runtime is always Θ(WN + WR) regardless because it has to examine all the keys. For MSD, the best case is when each key differs by the top letter (for example: "druid", "hunter", "mage", "paladin", "rogue"), and the worst case is when every key is the same.

### Problem 2
Question #6 from Princeton’s  [Spring 2012 Final](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring15/cos226/exams/fin-s12.pdf)

## B Level
### Problem 1
Give the number of characters examined by MSD string sort for a file of N keys a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa, ...
**Ans**: Since all the characters are the same, every character has to be examined: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... N = N(N-1)/2.
### Problem 2
For very long random strings, would a comparison based sort or a radix sort be faster? For very long, highly similar string, which would be faster?

**Ans**: Merge sort has runtime between Θ(N log N) for dissimilar strings and Θ(WN log N) for identical strings. LSD has runtime Θ(WN + WR) always, MSD has runtime between Θ(N + R) for dissimilar strings and Θ(WN + WR) for identical strings.
Treating R as a constant, for long random strings (which are dissimilar with high probability), MSD < mergesort < LSD (in terms of runtime).  For long, similar strings, MSD < LSD < mergesort (in terms of runtime). 
### Problem 3
For very long sequences of Java ints, would radix sort or a comparison sort be faster?
**Ans**: Radix sort.
