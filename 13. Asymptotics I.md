# 13. Asymptotics I
## Overview
### Runtime Minimization
- goal: make programs that run as fast as possible
### Runtime Measurement
- techniques:
	- stopwatch: dependent on machine/input
	- operation counting: machine independent but depends on input
	- algebraic expressions: scaling
### Alg Scaling
- scaling is the most important factor
	- ex: N + 500000 is better than N^2^
- real-world performance-critical situations are usually for large N
### Simplifying Runtimes
- simplifications
	- pick *cost model*
	- focus on worst case
	- ignore small inputs + constant factors
- ex: N to N^2^ + 2N + 6 -> N^2^
- cost model should be constant time and representative of code
### Orders of Growth
- constant, linear, quadratic: 1, N, N^2^ respectiely
### Simplified Analysis
- simplify in advance: count only cost model
	- compute exact expression and simplify or...
	- use intuition/inspection
- geometric intuition (ex: area of triangle)
### Big Theta
- $R(N) \in \Theta(f(N))$ means $k_1f(N) \leq R(N) \leq k_2f(N)$
- same as order of growth
# Exercises
## B Level
### Problem 1
Suppose we have a function `bleepBlorp`, and its runtime R(N) has order of growth Θ(N^2^). Which of the following can we say?
-   R(N) ∈ Θ(N^2^)
	- **Ans**: true, by definition of big Theta
-   R(N) ∈ Θ(N^2^) for any inputs
	- **Ans**: true, by definition of big Theta
-   R(N)∈Θ(N^2^) for worst cas inputs
	- **Ans**: true, by definition of big Theta
-   For large N, if we run bleepBlorp on an input of size N, and an input of size 10N, we will have to wait roughly 100 times as long for the larger input.
	- **Ans**: true, since scales quadratically
-   If we run bleepBlorp on an input of size 1000, and an input of size 10000, we will have to wait roughly 100 times as long for the larger input.
	- **Ans**: False, 1000 may not be large enough of an input to see quadratic scaling (consider R(N) = 100000 + N^2^)
