# 26. Minimum Spanning Trees, Kruskal's, Prim's
## Overview
### MSTs
- (for undirected graphs), spanning tree T: connected, acyclic, including all vertices
- MST: spanning tree with min edge weights
- MST != SPT
### Cut Property
- divide vertices into 2 edges -> crossing edge (S -> T)
- min crossing edge for any cut is in MST
### Prim's
- to find MST:
	- start at any src
	- repeatedly add shortest edge between some vertex in tree -> some vertex outside tree
	- if MST unique, then result independent of src
- basically Dijkstra's with vertices in order of distance from entire tree under construction
```
relax(e):
    v = e.source
    w = e.target        
    currentBestKnownWeight = distTo(w)
    possiblyBetterWeight = e.weight // Only difference!
    if possiblyBetterWeight > currentBestKnownWeight
        Use e instead of whatever we were using before
```
- O(E log V)
### Kruskal's
```
Initialize the MST to be empty
Consider each edge e in INCREASING order of weight:
    If adding e to the MST does not result in a cycle, add it to e
```
- O(E lg* V) if pre-sorted, or O(E log E) if not
- proof: cut property
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
Problem 2 from [Princeton’s Spring 2008 final](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-s08.pdf#page=3).
[solution](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-f08-sol.pdf)
### Problem 2
Would Kruskal or Prim’s algorithm work on a directed graph?

**Ans**: Prim's fails for directed graphs since it assumes that every node is reachable, but in directed graphs, it's possible to have an unreachable node. Kruskal's also fails on directed graphs because it will find cycles where none actually exist based on the union-find implementation. 
### Problem 3
True or false: Adding a constant to every edge weight does not change the solution to the MST problem (assume unique edge weights).

**Ans**: True. Remember the cut property--any MST-finding algorithm basically divides the tree into 2 cuts and finds the minimum crossing edge. The minimum crossing edge doesn't change when you add a constant to every single edge.

### Problem 4
True or false: Multiplying all edges weights with a constant does not change the solution to the MST problem (assume unique edge weights).

**Ans**: False. This is only true if you're multiplying by a *positive* constant. However, if you multiply by 0 or a negative constant, the relative order of the edges changes and so does the MST. (Thanks to Rahul for catching this!)

### Problem 5
True or false: It is possible that the only Shortest Path Tree is the only Minimum Spanning Tree.

**Ans**: True. Consider a spindly tree (which is basically a linked list). 

### Problem 6
True or false: Prim’s Algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm will always return the same result.

**Ans**: False. Any minimum spanning tree can be returned.
## B Level
### Problem 1
Prove the following, known as the cycle property: Given any cycle in an edge weighted graph (all edge weights distinct), the edge of maximum weight in the cycle does not belong to the MST of the graph.

**Ans**: For contradiction, suppose that our MST $T$ has the maximum-weight edge in a cycle $e$. Then we must exclude one of the other edges, $f$,  in the cycle $C$ (since an MST cannot have a cycle). 
Deleting $e$ breaks the MST into 2 different subtrees. The rest of $C$ is in the two subtrees $T_1$ and $T_2$, thus adding any edge that is part of $C$ will reconnect the two subtrees. 
We pick $f$ and add it back to $T$ to form $T^\prime$. Then $T^\prime$ has a lower weight than $T$, so $T$ cannot be the MST. This is a contradiction; thus $e$ cannot be in the MST.

### Problem 2
Problem 3 from [Princeton’s Fall 2009 final](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-f09.pdf#page=5)  (part d is pretty hard).
[solution](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-f09-sol.pdf)
### Problem 3
Problem 4 from  [Princeton’s Fall 2012 final](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-f12.pdf#page=5).
[solution](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-f12-sol.pdf)
### Problem 4
Suppose that a graph has distinct edge weights. Does its shortest edge have to belong to the MST? Can its longest edge belong to the MST? Does a min-weight edge on every cycle have to belong to the MST? Prove your answer to each question or give a counterexample.

**Ans**: The shortest edge must belong the the MST. Create a cut that includes 2 sets: the node on one end of the shortest edge, and everything else in the graph. Then the minimum crossing edge is the shortest edge, which must be in the MST.
The longest edge can be in the MST. For example, consider a graph that is a tree. Then every edge has to be in the MST, including the longest.
*Note: unsure about this last part about cycles*
The min-weight edge on every cycle must also belong to the MST. Suppose the min-weight edge on the cycle did not belong to the MST. Then, in a similar proof to problem 1, you can swap out one of the edges on the cycle with the min-weight edge and get a smaller MST; this is a contradiction and thus the min-weight edge on the cycle must be in the MST.

### Problem 5
True or false: At any point during the execution of Kruskal’s algorithm, each vertex is closer to some vertex in its subtree than to any vertex not in its subtree. Prove your answer.

**Ans**: True. In Kruskal's, you add the edges in increasing order of weight. For contradiction, suppose that there is a vertex $v$ and some vertex $u$ not in $v$'s subtree. Suppose that none of the vertices in $v$'s subtree have edge weight less than $(v, u)$. Then the edge $(v, u)$ should have been added before any of the other edges in $v$'s subtree. The only reason it would not be added is if $(v, u)$ formed a cycle, but it cannot form a cycle since it should have been the first edge added in $v$'s subtree. Thus, $u$ is actually in $v$'s subtree.

### Problem 6
True or False: Given any two components that are generated as Kruskal’s algorithm is running (but before it has completed), the smallest edge connecting those two components is part of the MST.

**Ans**: False. Consider the image below. The minimum weight edge connecting the two components is 500 but clearly this is not included in the actual MST.

### Problem 7
Problem 11 from  [Hug's Fall 2014 final](http://datastructur.es/sp15/materials/exams/fin-f14.pdf#page=13).

Answer the following questions true or false, assuming that our edge weights
are unique, and may be negative, zero, or positive. If the answer is true, give a brief explanation why (do not provide a formal proof). If it is false, give a counterexample. Assume we are always referring to connected graphs with no self edges in the following questions.

a. Given a graph G, if we add some constant k to every edge weight, G’s minimal spanning tree(s) remain unchanged.
**Ans**: True. See C level Problem 3 above.
b. Assuming every vertex is reachable from a given source, Dijkstra’s algorithm always
finds a shortest path from that source to every vertex?
**Ans**: True. This is the definition of Dijkstra's.
c. The shortest edge in any cycle can always be a part of a minimal spanning tree.
**Ans**: True. See problem 5.
d. The total weight of a MST of an undirected graph is always less than or equal to the
total weight of any shortest-path tree for that graph.
**Ans**: True. The SPT is a spanning tree so you can just use that as the MST.
### Problem 8
Problem 13 from [Hug's fall 2014 final](http://datastructur.es/sp15/materials/exams/fin-f14.pdf#page=15).

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/VtXzn5z/26-b-9.png)
a. List the weights of the seven edges in the MST other than X, Y , and Z.
**Ans**: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 110
b. True or false: The value of edge weight X could be 120.
**Ans**: False. If X was 120, we would have added the edge of weight 90 before it (but we didn't since it forms a cycle).
c. True or false: The value of edge weight Y could be 55.
**Ans**: True.
d. What is the largest possible value of edge weight Z, assuming Z is some integer, and all edge weights are unique?
**Ans**: 119. (Otherwise we would have added 120 to the MST).
### Problem 9
How would you find the Minimum Spanning Tree where you calculate the weight based off the product of the edges rather than the sum. You may assume that edge weights are > 1.

**Ans**: Take the log of each value. $log(x_1x_2x_3...) = log(x_1) + log(x_2) + ...$ which again reduces to the minimum edge sum.

## A Level
### Problem 1
Problem 3 from  [Princeton’s Spring 2008 final](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-s08.pdf#page=4).
[solution](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos226/exams/fin-s08-sol.pdf)
### Problem 2
Problem 5 from  [Kartik’s Algorithm Worksheet](http://www.kartikkapur.com/documents/DataStructureDesign.pdf#page=2).
You are the rich Roman Emperor Jewelius Caesar. You want to build arenas (possibly more than one) so your subjects can watch gladiator duels and eat wild boars. 
• You have V locations where you can build arenas and it costs $v_i$ denarius’s to build an arena in the ith location. 
• Additionally, any location that does not have an arena must have a path to an arena. You are provided a set of roads, denoted by E, that you can build between any 2 locations i and j, along with their cost denoted by $e_ij$ . Find or modify an algorithm that will minimize the amount of denarius’s your kingdom will spend while still fulfilling your constraints.

**Ans**: Add a dummy node $v^*$, and connect each $v$ to it with a weight corresponding to its cost. Then, find the MST--if a particular $v_i$ is connected to $v^*$ you should build an arena there, otherwise you shouldn't.
### Problem 3
Rigorously prove the following: For any cut C, if the weight of any edge e is smaller than all the other edges across C, then this edge is part of the Minimum Spanning Tree.

**Ans**: For contradiction, suppose $e$ is not in the MST, $T$. Adding any edge to a tree creates a cycle; thus adding $e$ also creates a cycle. Because there is a cycle, there must be another edge $f$ connecting the two cuts, with $|f| > |e|$. Then we can replace $f$ with $e$ to get a lower-weight spanning tree--we have found a spanning tree with lower weight than our MST, $T$. This is a contradiction, thus $e$ must be in the MST.
### Problem 4
An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. Show how to find all critical edges in a graph in time proportional to E log E . Note : This question assumes that edge weights are not necessarily distinct (otherwise all edges in the MST are critical).

**Ans**: In order to maintain the connectedness of the graph after removal, any critical edge must be part of a cycle. Use a WQU to detect cycles, and for each edge $e$ that is part of a cycle, check each cycle to see if there's an edge with larger weight than $e$. If there is, then $e$ is a critical edge.
