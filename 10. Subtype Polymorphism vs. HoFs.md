# 10. Subtype Polymorphism vs. HoFs
## Overview
### Typing Rules
- compiler allows memory boxes to hold any subtype
	- checks calls based ons tatic types
	- selects overloaded method signature at compile time
- overidden nonstatic methods are selected at runtime based on dynamic type
### Subtype Polymorphism
- subclasses have different behavior based on dynamic type
- ex: `max` of any type of array
	- `max(Object[] items)` using > fails
	- solution: use a Comparable interface
### Comparable
- guarantees that any object in the interface has a `compareTo` method
### Comparators
- natural order implied by `Comparable compareTo`
- to order by something else, use `Comparator<T>` interface with `compare()` method
