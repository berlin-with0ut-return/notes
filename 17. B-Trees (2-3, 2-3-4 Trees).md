# 17. B-Trees (2-3, 2-3-4 Trees)
## Overview
### BSTs
- depth: distance from root (root = 0)
- height: depth of deepest node
- BST height varies! spindly ~ N, bushy ~ log N
- fast operations depend on bushy BSTs
### BTrees
- 2-3 Trees (each node has 2-3 children), 2-3-4 Trees (each node has 2-4 children)
- "overstuffing" to prevent height increasing -> logN height
- Î˜(log N) runtimes
- invariants:
	- all leaves are same dist from src
	- non-leaf node with k items has k + 1 children

### Problem 2
How many compares does it take in the worst case to decide whether to go left, middle, or right from a 3-node?

**Ans**: 2. Compare the current/search item to the smaller item in the 3-node, and the larger item in the 3-node. If curr < smaller, go left; if smaller < curr < larger, go to the middle; if curr > larger, go to the right.
