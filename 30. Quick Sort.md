# 30. Quick Sort
## Overview
### Insertion Sort
- insertion sort fast for small arrays (N < 15), almost sorted
### Partitioning
- reararnge array: left < pivot, = pivot, right > pivot
- pivot moves during partitioning
### Quicksort
- partition on pivot
- recursively quicksort left, right
- runtime: Θ(N log N) best case, Θ(N^2^) worst case
### Pivot Selection
- choice of partitioning strategy, pivot affect runtime
- leftmost: can lead to bad performance
	- better: random pivot
### Randomization
- on avg, quicksort has Θ(n log n) runtime
	- ensure avg case by picking random pivot/shuffling
- empirically, quicksort is fastest
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
Give a worst case input for Quicksort. Assume that we’re always picking the leftmost item as our pivot.

**Ans**: Any sorted or reverse-sorted array, ex 12345.
## B Level
### Problem 1
What is the recursive depth of quicksort, in the best, worst, and average cases? This is the size of the call stack that the system needs to keep track of the recursive calls.

**Ans**: In the worst case, your input goes from size N -> N - 1 -> N - 2... 1, requiring a stack of depth N.
In the best case, your input gets divided exactly in half each time, going from N -> N/2 -> ... 4 -> 2 -> 1 requiring a stack of depth lgN.
The average case is Θ(log N).
### Problem 2
Suppose we use an enhanced partitioning strategy that splits items into three types: items < the pivot, items = to the pivot, and items > the pivot. Supposing that this 3-way partitioning strategy takes Θ(N) time. Prove that Quicksort on an array with N items but only 7 distinct keys (e.g. [0, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, …, 2, 6]) runs in Θ(N) time.

**Ans**: Take the worst case, where you continuously pick the smallest item as the pivot; the array looks something like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, ....].
First you pick 0 as the pivot; then after partitioning in N time we have a new array with items from 1...6 of size N - 1. Pick 1 as the pivot, then repeat, picking 2, 3, 4, 5 as the pivots. Now you're left with an array of size N - 5 with 6 as the pivot. 
After partitioning around 6, you're done--the left subproblems have already been sorted and there is no right subproblem since nothing can be greater than 6. In total, this took (N - 1) + (N - 2) + (N - 3) + (N - 4) + (N - 5) + (N - 6) ~ 6N comparisons, which is Θ(N).

## A+ Level
### Problem 1
Find an array of integers that causes Arrays.sort to crash.  `Arrays.sort(int[])`  uses Quicksort. See  `http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/mdmspe.pdf`  for some ideas.

**Ans**: Too hard for me, sorry. Java 7 and onwards uses dual-pivot quicksort. The basic idea is to find some array where you continously choose the smallest and largest items as the two pivots.
