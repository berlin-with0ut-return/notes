# 30. Quick Sort
## Overview
### Insertion Sort
- insertion sort fast for small arrays (N < 15), almost sorted
### Partitioning
- reararnge array: left < pivot, = pivot, right > pivot
- pivot moves during partitioning
### Quicksort
- partition on pivot
- recursively quicksort left, right
- runtime: Θ(N log N) best case, Θ(N^2^) worst case
### Pivot Selection
- choice of partitioning strategy, pivot affect runtime
- leftmost: can lead to bad performance
	- better: random pivot
### Randomization
- on avg, quicksort has Θ(n log n) runtime
	- ensure avg case by picking random pivot/shuffling
- empirically, quicksort is fastest
# Exercises
## B Level
### Problem 1
Give a best and worst case input for insertion sort.
**Ans**: Best case is 0 inversions, ex [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Worst case is N(N-1)/2 inversions, ex [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

### Problem 2
Which sort do you expect to run more quickly on a reversed array, selection sort or insertion sort?
**Ans**: They're the same??
*Note: not sure about this solution. But counting comparisons seems to indicate the two algorithms have the exact same runtime...*
Suppose we have the reversed sorted array [N, N - 1, N - 2... 2, 1].
Selection sort will have to examine N items to find the minimum, then N - 1, then N - 2... (ignore swapping since that's constant time). N + (N - 1) + (N - 2) ... = N(N - 1)/2.
Insertion sort will have to swap N(N-1)/2 items (this is the number of inversions).
