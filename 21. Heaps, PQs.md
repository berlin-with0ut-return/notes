# 21. Heaps, PQs
## Overview
### PQs
- ADT that supports insert + delete max
- minPQ: insert + delete min
### Heaps
- array representation of binary tree (complete)
- every node smaller/larger than all children (recursively)
### PQ Implementations
- unordered array, ordered array, and heap
# Exercises
## C Level
### Problem 1
Is an array that is sorted in descending order also a max-oriented heap?

**Ans**: Yes.
### Problem 2
Criticize the following idea: to implement _find the maximum_ in constant time, why not keep track of the maximum value inserted so far, then return that value for _find the maximum_?

**Ans**: Consider if you delete the maximum. Then you have to spend linear time to find the next maximum item.

### Problem 4
Why do we leave the 0th position empty in our array representation for heaps?

**Ans**: Makes indexing nicer.

## B Level
### Problem 1
The largest item in a heap must appear in position 1, and the second largest must appear in position 2 or 3. Give the list of positions in a heap of size 31 where the kth largest CAN appear, and where the kth largest CANNOT appear for k=2, 3, 4. Assume values are distinct.

**Ans**: The second largest can appear anywhere from 2-3 (level 2), the third-largest can appear anywhere from position 2-7 (level 2 or 3), and the fourth-largest can appear anywhere from 2-15 (level 2, 3, or 4).

### Problem 2
Suppose we wish to avoid wasting one position in a heap-ordered array pq[], putting the largest value in pq[0], its children in pq[1] and pq[2], and so forth, proceeding in level order. Where are the parents and children of pq[k]?

**Ans**: 
`parent = (k - 1)/2`
`left = k * 2 + 1`
`right = 2 * (k + 1)`

### Problem 3
Explain how to use a priority queue to implement the stack and queue data types.

**Ans**: Keep a counter. For each item inserted into the queue, insert it with the counter as its priority. Use a MinPQ for a queue, a MaxPQ for the stack.

### Problem 4
Add a min() method to a maximum-oriented PQ. Your implementation should use constant time and constant extra space.

**Ans**: Keep an auxiliary `min` variable that tracks the minimum inserted item, updating after each insertion. Note that this is not affected by deletions since `min` won't be deleted until the PQ is empty.

### Problem 5
What is the minimum number of items that must be exchanged during a remove-the-max operation in a heap of size N with no duplicate keys? Give a heap of size 15 for which the minimum is achieved. Answer the same question for two and three successive remove-the-maximum operations.

**Ans**: The minimum is 2 exchanges.

Applying the same principle you can see that an additional 2 are required for another delete-the-max operation.

## A Level
### Problem 1
Design a data type that supports insert in O(log N) time, find-the-median in O(1) time, and delete-the-median in O(log N) time.

**Ans**: Use two heaps, one min-heap and one max-heap. 

When you insert, always insert into the min heap. When the size of the min-heap exceeds 1 + (size of max-heap), pop off items from the min-heap and move it the the max-heap.

To get the median, compare the heap sizes. If the heap sizes are equal, average the two roots. Otherwise, the median is the min-heap's root.

To delete the median (assuming an odd number of items, otherwise this doesn't make sense), delete from the root of the min-heap. Rebalance items as necessary (ensuring that min-heap size = max-heap size or min-heap size = (1 + max-heap size)).

## A Level
### Problem 2
Design a data type that supports insert in O(log N) time, delete-the-max in O(log N) time, and delete-the-minimum in O(log N) time.

**Ans**: ... use a BST?

*Note: If this seems too easy, see [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-data-structure-question/). Basically, a two heaps with references to a mutual data structure.*
