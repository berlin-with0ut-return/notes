# 23. Tree and Graph Traversals
## Overview
### Trees
- set of ndoes, edges
- only 1 path btwn any 2 nodes
- all connected, no cycles
### Traversals
- iterate over tree nodes
### Level Order
- left-to-right, top-to-bottom
### Depth-First Traversal
- pre-order: node, left, right
- inorder: left, node, right
- post-order: left, right, node
- pre/post-order work for non-binary trees too (node before children and children before node respectively)
### Graphs
- nodes, edges but can have more than 1 path
- simple graph:
