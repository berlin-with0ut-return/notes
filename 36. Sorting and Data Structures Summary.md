# 36. Sorting and Data Structures Conclusion
## Overview
### Radix vs. Comparison Sorts
- cost model: number of characters examined
- MSD: O(NM) characters; merge sort: O(MN log N)
	- merge sort slower by a factor of log N
- but empirically, mergesort is faster
	- causes: cache, optimized methods, copy operations, etc
### JIT Compiler
- interpreter reimplements code as it runt to optimize
	- ex: create objects w/o using -> save time by not creating objects
- without JIT, mergesort is slower
### Radix Sorting Ints
- getDigit with stringification or mod/div
- can use multiple bases--runtime changes with alphabet size
